			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>As I am pursuing a <a href="http://web.cs.toronto.edu/home.htm" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> specialist and a <a href="http://www.utstat.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">Statistics</a> major at the <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">University of Toronto</a>, I am excited to see where my future career in this field will take me. I am looking forward to using my skills in a challenging and rewarding position during my <a href="http://web.cs.toronto.edu/program/ugrad/pey.htm" target="_blank">Professional Experience Year</a> which will take place between May/2014 and September/2015 between my 3rd and 4th years. I will graduate with a Bachelor of Science in April/2016. <br><br>When I'm not studying, I work part-time as an archivist at <a href="http://www.tsn.ca/" target="_blank"> TSN</a>. I commute to campus, to my job and run all my errands via bicycle. I became a commuter cyclist as a way to stay active and save money, but have since become a cycling enthusiast. I enjoy reading non-fiction books about diverse subjects, but those that really interest me are usually related to sociology and human nature in some way. I am a die-hard fan of the ongoing shows Suits and The Walking Dead but I also have a peculiar fondness for old episodes of The Muppet Show. </p>
